All plot info is in results/2023-08-17
X Recreate run_2c plot (transfer vs raw on sample holdouts)
X Recreate pdx run_2c plot (transfer vs raw on ea. sample individually)
- Create precision-recall / ROC curves from pdx predictions
===
- Plot embeddings for REP-GDSC-CTD2: initially just s (red) vs s' (blue)
- Plot embeddings for pdx: inititally just s (red) vs s' (blue)
===
- compute raw score for run_2d using the auc_overlap (or do this after / later?)
- Recreate run_2d plot (transfer vs target-only vs raw)
- Create experiments saved plot from run_2d data
- ** Send above plots to Wes **

- Are mannwhitenyu p-values in the pdx run_2c plot still the same? Does this make sense?

- Outline paper
- ** Send paper outline to Wes **
- Set up registration on ML4H website
- Slack email/info to msk slack

(Later:)
- Create graphical abstract for paper 

(Maybe:)
- Create precision-recall / ROC curves from run_2c predictions
