# Goals:
# X write a file to simply assign an MID to each mouse
# X write a file to plot the mouse tumor growth for one MID
# X plot mouse tumor growths to file
# X combine all mouse tumor growth plots into one master file
# - analyze and investigate weird mids!
# - interpolate tumor growth for day 25
# - figure out how to split into train + test (by drug, sample pairs)
# - split data, and remove the test set
# - clean up matching samples, drugs
# - write up a quick summary of the problem, what you've done so far!

# Pyro:
# - download & install pyro
# - try a really small test example (eg 2 x 2 matrix) w/ same normal form

# Questions & More:
# - ask about splitting data; should I only interpolate using training data? (and ignore test?)
# - should I have a validation set and a test set? or not enough data for that?
# - how do we know if we have enough data to build this model?
# - how do we know that this is the right Bayesian model to use?
# - read up more on Pyro and on Bayesian Models
