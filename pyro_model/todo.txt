MODEL SELECTION
X create heatmap for train and test
X create individual line plots (by r and k)
X combine everything into a new digest_heatmap.py, and run on most recent cluster scripts
===
- save input params for script along with test/train averages: include r, k values! (incase not just range)
- implement cross-validation holding out samples
- implement switch between random-holdout and sample-holdout
- implement data cleaning that does log(auc)
- implement switch between auc and loc(auc)
===
- write pipeline to run model, post-process, and copy data back to local storage in 1 - 2 clicks!
=============================================================
- run on all pairs of datasets X {random-holdout, sample-holdout} X {auc, log(auc)}
- post-process all data
- choose the best model parameters
=============================================================
- discuss plots w Wes to choose parameters
- Outcomes: 
--- we know the best (r, k) to use for each dataset combination --> choose (r, k) peak
--- we know whether to use auc or log(auc) or whether there is any difference






























PDX DATA
- download all datafiles
- clean data so that it can be processed by the model: may require fitting auc curves, getting data into T/C format
- create cleaning + stats pipeline: clean, take logs, do normality tests, spit out basic stats
- run pdx data through cleaning + stats pipeline
- discuss results with Wes
=============================================================
- Outcome: Know whether this data works for our purposes

PIPELINES
- have full pipeline for cleaning, pre-processing/stats, and model selection. should result in final (r, k) value
- run invitro data through cleaning + stats pipeline: may need separate pipeline
