X re-write code to digest results
X recreate plots
- run code on cluster for all combinations, and @ 50 model-restarts per seed
- digest these results into figures 
- add confidence intervals to plots
- insert plots into ppt
=================================================================
- re-write code so that it's easy to read
- write intro & exit ppt slides

Further Tasks for Future Results:
=================================================================
- write code to run single-dataset outcomes on cluster
- write code so that you vary the number of datapoints used
- run this code and digest it into plots
- insert plots into ppt
