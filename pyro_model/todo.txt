X write script to run heatmap experiments
X find script currently using to digest results (including m, getting the averages, etc)
X update script to digest heatmap experiments: finish adding mask checks
X write digest_heatmap.sh
X add analysis to digest_heatmap.py
X test files locally
X copy files to cluster
- debug digest results: run on dummy array of same size, but with indices as values to see where processing goes wrong
- on cluster, run test (short) heatmap experiment: test run & digest/processing --- use prime numbers for dimensions!
- load data into jupyter notebook and play around
- run heatmap on one pair --> determine general parameters to run
- create scripts for all pairs to run
