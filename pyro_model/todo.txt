X write script to run heatmap experiments
X find script currently using to digest results (including m, getting the averages, etc)
X update script to digest heatmap experiments: finish adding mask checks
X write digest_heatmap.sh
X add analysis to digest_heatmap.py
X test files locally
X copy files to cluster
X OR: rewrite digest so that the indexing, mean, etc is done on all values; only process into a triangle at the end!
X debug digest results: run on dummy array of same size, but with indices as values to see where processing goes wrong
X copy digest_heatmap.py over to cluster
X on cluster, run test (short) heatmap experiment: test run & digest/processing --- use prime numbers for dimensions!
- run real experiment on cluster and digest
- copy data over to local direcotry
- load data into jupyter notebook and play around
- ** save input params with test/train averages! **
