# Write scripts for cluster, updating data dir (to read from) in all of them
# Write test scripts for cluster as well
# Write function to save train/test splits and input params to the correct places
# Copy all code over to cluster
# Process for cluster:
# (1) Run data cleaning & processing script on cluster
# (2) After (1) finishes, run test scripts. Test scripts should look just like the real ones, only with fewer samples drawn
# (3) Run digest script on output of (2)
# (4) Run full scripts!
# (5) Check in to make sure scripts are running successfully (w/ no errors)
