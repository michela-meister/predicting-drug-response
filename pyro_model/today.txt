TODO UPON RETURN:
X save dataset with log_auc 
X save dataset with logit_auc (clean_multi_datasets)
X normality tests to plot auc, log(auc), logit(auc) (multi_normality)
X for cleaning published vals, need to first drop all rows w nans
X debug the issue with processing the CTD2 dataset
X input results into google doc!
===========================================================
X read in datasets
X average values
X get sample, drug names, count
X recreate paper stats on correlation / concordance (look up!)
for both raw and log:
X calculate correlation / concordance (look up what is used in paper): pearson, spearman
X scatter plots btwn datasets
X plot distribution of values
===========================================================
- implement running (k, r) on multiple seeds
- write script to run grid
- implement loss function --> use loss to cut-off run
- run grid of r x k params (for both log and raw)
- plot results
- plot comparing output correlation to paper correlation (on same train/test)
===========================================================
- discuss w Wes
- do k-fold cross val?
- try with different sizes of test dataset

- dataset stats: sample-drug counts, matlab correlation plot, heatmap plot, number of duplicate readings
- plot distribution of auc values, log(auc) for different datasets
- look up concordance & understand claims of similarity in original paper (& try to reproduce these)
- scatter plot comparing different datasets (take mean of same sample-drug pairs?), plotting pearson, spearman correlations
============================================================
- take log of auc
- implement running (k, r) on multiple seeds
- run with k=1, r ranging from 0 to 10
- implement loss function --> use loss to cut-off run
- run grid of r x k params
============================================================
- plot AUC_dataset1 vs AUC_dataset2; plot AUC_dataset2 vs predict(AUC_dataset2)
- add extra params to model (?)
- how much more is "explained" by predict()? (and how does this relate to correlation?)
- run a test on the model where you create a low rank mapping U and see if the model can identify this mapping (ie the r-value is best); can do this with a specific k as well
============================================================
** Combine everything in notebook!! **
** Clean-up scripts, convert to python scripts **

QUESTIONS:
- Is low rank a problem??
- What are the best comparisons? To a human? To another dataset?
- Ask Wes about process for fitting curves and computing AUC values. Why are there so many 1's?
- why are there multiple AUC's for some sample, drug pairs?
- how to handle multiple values when computing correlation? (Take mean?) Esp correlation between datasets
- is the S, D decomposition unique? Is it ok that we only learn S and not D?
