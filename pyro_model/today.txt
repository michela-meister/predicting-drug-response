- Fixed error in multi_eval: bug was that I'd set n_train based on number of observations (a very big number) but then applied it to pairs (a smaller number)
- Figured out how to plot loss (can add this in later to optimize training time...)
- Plotted train and test acc for REP model!
- Passed in rank-5 matrix to check model for debugging

TODO
- Code up model w low rank: Should transform S to S'
- Plot same train-test curves for dumb low-rank option & combine together in notebook
- Walk through model with Wes!

LATER
- Could try running model with even higher rank!
- Incorporate svi loss to decide when to stop running
- Fix vectorized model so that it's different in rank 1 case? (Has extra vectors?)
