TODO UPON RETURN:
- what is this auc value?
- normality tests to plot auc, log_auc
- scatter plot comparing different datasets (take mean of same sample-drug pairs?)
- plot pearson, spearman correlation for datasets (w/ means)
============================================================
- take log of auc
- implement running (k, r) on multiple seeds
- run with k=1, r ranging from 0 to 10
- implement loss function --> use loss to cut-off run
- run grid of r x k params
============================================================
- plot AUC_dataset1 vs AUC_dataset2; plot AUC_dataset2 vs predict(AUC_dataset2)
- add extra params to model (?)
- how much more is "explained" by predict()? (and how does this relate to correlation?)
- run a test on the model where you create a low rank mapping U and see if the model can identify this mapping (ie the r-value is best); can do this with a specific k as well
============================================================
** Combine everything in notebook!! **

QUESTIONS:
- Ask Wes about process for fitting curves and computing AUC values. Why are there so many 1's?
- why are there multiple AUC's for some sample, drug pairs?
- how to handle multiple values when computing correlation? (Take mean?) Esp correlation between datasets
- is the S, D decomposition unique? Is it ok that we only learn S and not D?
