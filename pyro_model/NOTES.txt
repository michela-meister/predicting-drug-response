Notes on how to recreate results.

================= GDSC-REP-CTD2 =============================================

RUN_2C / COMPARE TRANSFER TO RAW ON SAMPLE HOLDOUTS
correlations: Documents/research/drug-response-repo/drug-response/pyro_model/results/2023-08-10_clust/run_2c/analysis/results.csv
sample predictions: (directory) Documents/research/drug-response-repo/drug-response/pyro_model/results/2023-08-10_clust/run_2c

RUN_2D / COMPARE TRANSFER TO TARGET-ONLY TO RAW ON VARYING HOLDOUT FRACTIONS
correlations: Documents/research/drug-response-repo/drug-response/pyro_model/results/2023-08-10_clust/run_2d/analysis/results.csv
other source directories: 2023-08-11_clust, 2023-08-12_clust
sample predictions: N/A

EMBEDDINGS / GDSC-REP-CTD2 EMBEDDINGS
(directory) Documents/research/drug-response-repo/drug-response/pyro_model/results/2023-08-13_clust/embeddings_expt

RAW ON AUC_OVERLAP
(directory) Documents/research/drug-response-repo/drug-response/pyro_model/results/2023-08-14_clust/run_2c_raw_overlap

================== PDO / PDX ================================================

PDX_RUN_2C / COMPARE TRANSFER TO RAW ON SAMPLE HOLDOUTS, SMALL PDX DATA (yaspo_combined.csv)
correlations: Documents/research/drug-response-repo/drug-response/pyro_model/results/2023-08-13_clust/pdx_expt/analysis/results.csv
sample predictions: (directory)  Documents/research/drug-response-repo/drug-response/pyro_model/results/2023-08-13_clust/pdx_expt
embeddings (small data): Documents/research/drug-response-repo/drug-response/pyro_model/results/2023-08-13_clust/pdx_embeddings_expt 

PDX_RUN_2C / COMPARE TRANSFER TO RAW ON SAMPLE HOLDOUTS, EXTENDED PDX DATA, ALSO SPEARMAN (yaspo_combined_intersection.csv)
(directory) Documents/research/drug-response-repo/drug-response/pyro_model/results/2023-08-14_clust/pdx_expt
sample predictions: ''
embeddings (extended): just ran...should save to 2023-08-15 on cluster
